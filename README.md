# My Contacts

Hello people, I have made an android application to manage contacts.

##  Functions

* Creating A new Contact
* Editing an Existing Contact
* Deleting a Contact
* Open Number in dialer

## Language Used
 
* Kotlin

##  Installation

If you want to try it out you can download the apk file [here.](https://github.com/RoshanShaikh/My-Contacts/raw/master/My-Contacts.apk)

**NOTE:** It does not display contacts saved on device, it will only work with contacts that are stored in it. So at startup of the App you will see an Empty List.
